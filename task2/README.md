# Object-Oriented Design Project

This project is dedicated to practicing and implementing object-oriented design (OOD) principles. The focus is on creating a well-structured system that adheres to the S.O.L.I.D. principles and demonstrates a strong foundation in OOD concepts.

## Objectives

- **Understand and Implement S.O.L.I.D. Principles**: 
  - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class will serve a single, clear purpose to ensure minimal reasons for change.
  - **Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes will be designed to allow extensions without requiring modification of existing code.
  - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses will be substitutable for their base classes without affecting functionality.
  - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces will be carefully designed to prevent dependencies on unused methods.
  - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules will rely on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.
  
- **Develop a Modular, Maintainable Codebase**: Each class and interface will follow principles of encapsulation and abstraction to build a flexible, reusable, and well-organized system.

## Project Structure

- **Core Classes**: Classes adhering to SRP, focusing on a single responsibility.
- **Extended Functionality**: Implementations demonstrating OCP and LSP, allowing easy extension without altering base functionality.
- **Interfaces and Abstractions**: Interfaces and abstract classes created following ISP and DIP, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java

## Notes

Each section of the codebase will include comments and explanations to highlight how each S.O.L.I.D. principle is applied. This project aims to strengthen my understanding of object-oriented principles and improve my skills in designing robust and adaptable software.
